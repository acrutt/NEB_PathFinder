# NEB_PathFinder

PathFinder Algorithm implementation can be found in PathFinder.py


An example of utilizing PathFinder Algorithm to initiate NEB calculations are presented in NEBInterpolate_empty.py. Note that the this is interpolation codes for NEB calculations at empty lattice limit, i.e. only one moving cation atom is
in the host structure.
